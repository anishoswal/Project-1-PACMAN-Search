# Project 1: PACMAN Search
## Description
- In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I built the general search algorithms and applied them to Pacman scenarios.
- This is the solution for [Project-1](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html) of the [CSE-188](http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html) course for University of California, Berkeley.
- Details regarding the files, working of the project, grading and my implementation can be found in the folder **"[search](search)"**
- There is a description file **"[Project-Description](Project-Description.pdf)"** which explains the tasks to be completed to get the project working.
- My autograder score achieved for this project is the maximum. i.e. **26/25**
